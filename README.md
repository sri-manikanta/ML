Machine Learning Projects
Machine Learning: A subset of artificial intelligence where computers use data to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning
    Supervised Learning: Models are trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are known.
        Example Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
    Unsupervised Learning: Models are trained on unlabeled data and must find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures.
        Example Algorithms: K-means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
    Reinforcement Learning: Models learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions.
        Example Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
